# SimplifiedTennisKATAJS

This is my code solution for the simplified tennis KATA in javascript.

See description of the KATA here: http://codingdojo.org/kata/Tennis/

To run the tests file please follow those steps:
  - open a terminale in the code directory (SimplifiedTennisKATAJS)
  - run : npm init -y to initiate the JS project
  - install the "jest" package using npm (npm install jest)
  - check if jest was correctly installed in the project (jest version will be displayed in package.json)
  - in the "scripts" section of the package.json file add("test": "jest --coverage")
  - coverage allow to show the code % that have been tested with the test file (in this case i made it to run 100% of the code)
